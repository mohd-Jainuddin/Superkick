            This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"), describes Superkicks's

            information provided by Users and Visitors (as defined herein below)
            of the Platforms. Superkicks shall not use the User's information in
            any manner except as provided under this Privacy Policy.

          <p>Every User who accesses or uses the Platforms shall
            be bound by this Privacy
            Policy. Our website uses encryption technology, like Secure Sockets
            Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data
            transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name,
            address, and credit card number. Our Customer Care center and stores
            also operate over a private, secure network. Please note that email is
            not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of
            transmitting credit card information.

              (collectively referred to as the "Services"), is his/ her/ its
              acceptance of the terms of use which also involves acceptance of
              the terms of this Privacy Policy. Any User who does not agree with
              any provisions of the Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy is

              4.2. While browsing the Platforms, a User is not required to

              Personally Identifiable Information, is voluntary. The User has
              the right to request the withdrawal of his/ her/ its consent at
              any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and

              himself/ herself/ itself or his/ her family members in use of any
              of the Services. Superkicks does not endorse the content, messages

              Services. As a condition to use the Services, you as a User agree

              the User is strongly advised to exercise discretion while
              providing Personal Information or Financial Information while
              using the Services given that the Internet is susceptible to
              security breaches.

              overall User trends and to help Superkicks in improving its
              services. Please note that the link between the User's IP address

              Superkicks's right to share some of the aggregate findings,
              including the Personal Information provided by the Users in an
              unidentifiable form, and not the specific data with advertisers,
              sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and others in order to
              help grow the business.The amount of information sent to
