            <p class="document_heading_para1">1.1. The Agreement, inter alia, provides the terms that govern your access
                to use (i) Superkicks’s website www.Superkicks.in, and its mobile and tablet applications (“Platforms”),
                (iii) Superkicks’s online lifestyle, fashion and electronics solutions, which inter alia facilitates
                sale and purchase of electronics, and lifestyle and fashion merchandise (“Products”) through the
                Platforms, and (iv) the purchase of Products, and any other service that may be provided by Superkicks
                from time to time (collectively referred to as the “Services”).</p>
            <p class="document_heading_para2">1.2. You hereby understand and agree that the Agreement forms a binding
                contract between Superkicks and anyone who accesses, browses, or purchases the Products and uses the
                Services in any manner (“User”) and accordingly, you hereby agree to be bound by the terms contained in
                the Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms contained in the Agreement, you are advised not to
                proceed with purchasing the Products or using the Services. The terms contained in the Agreement shall
                be accepted without modification. The use of the Services would constitute acceptance of the terms of
                the Agreement. </p>

        <div class="tcToUser">
            <h2 class="tcToUser_heading">2. Terms and Conditions Applicable to Users</h2>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para1">2.1. Users must be 18 years of age or older to register, or visit or use
                the Services in any manner. By registering, visiting or using the Services, you hereby represent and
                warrant to Superkicks that you are 18 years of age or older, and that you have the right, authority and
                capacity to use the Services, and agree to abide by the Agreement. If a User is below 18 years of age,
                it is assumed that he/ she is using/ browsing the Platforms under the supervision of his/ her parent or
                legal guardian and that such User’s parent or legal guardian has read and agrees to the terms of this
                Agreement, including terms of purchase of Products, on behalf of the minor User. Should Superkicks be
                made aware that a User is under the age of 18 and is using/ browsing the Platforms without the
                supervision of his/ her parent or legal guardian, Superkicks reserves the right to deactivate such
                User’s account without further notice.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para2">2.2. The Agreement is governed by the provisions of Indian law, including,
                but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2.2.1. the Indian Contract Act, 1872;</li>
                <li>2.2.2. the Information Technology Act, 2000;</li>
                <li>2.2.3. the rules, regulations, guidelines and clarifications framed thereunder, including the
                    Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal
                    Information) Rules, 2011 (“SPI Rules”) and;</li>
                <li>2.2.4. the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 (“IG Rules”).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para3">2.3. The contents of Services, information, text, graphics, images, logos,
                button icons, software code, interface, design and the collection, arrangement and assembly of the
                content on the Platforms or any of the other Services are the property of Superkicks, its parent
                company, group companies, subsidiaries, associates, affiliates, suppliers, vendors and sister companies,
                as the case may be (“Superkicks Content”), and are protected under copyright, trademark and other
                applicable laws. You shall not modify the Superkicks Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform,
                distribute, reverse engineer or otherwise use the Superkicks Content in any way for any public or
                commercial purpose or for personal gain.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para4">2.4. Superkicks authorises you to view and access the Superkicks Content
                solely for identifying Products, carrying out purchases of Products and processing returns and refunds,
                in accordance with Return and Refund Policy, if any. Superkicks, therefore, grants you a limited,
                revocable permission to access and use the Services. This permission does not include a permission for
                carrying out any resale of the Products or commercial use of the Superkicks Content, any collection and
                use of product listings, description, or prices, and, any derivative use of the Platforms or of
                Superkicks Content.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para5">2.5. As means to assist the Users in identifying the Products of their
                choice, Superkicks provides visual representations on the Platforms including graphics, illustrations,
                photographs, images, videos, charts, screenshots, infographics and other visual aids. While reasonable
                efforts are made to provide accurate visual representations, Superkicks disclaims any guarantee or
                warranty of exactness of such visual representation or description of the Product, with the actual
                Product ultimately delivered to Users. The appearance of the Product when delivered may vary for various
                reasons.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para6">2.6. Users may make purchases on the Platforms. For the purposes of
                identifying a User, Superkicks may, from time to time, collect certain personally identifiable
                information such as your first name and last name, email address, mobile phone number, postal address,
                other contact information, demographic profile, etc. Users may also register themselves on the
                Platforms. Registration on the Platforms is one-time and you are required to remember your username and
                password and keep the same confidential. In the event where you have misplaced your username and
                password details, you can retrieve and change the same using the “forgot username/ password” option on
                the Platforms.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para7">2.7. The User shall assume all risks, liabilities, and consequences if
                his/ her account has been accessed illegally or without authorisation through means such as hacking and
                if through such unauthorised access, a purchase of Products has been made through the Services. It is
                specifically clarified that payments of monies towards any Products purchased through the Services by
                unauthorised or illegal use of the User’s account shall entirely be borne by the User.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para8">2.8. Display of Products for purchase on the Platforms is merely an
                invitation to offer. An order placed by a User for purchase of a Product constitutes an offer. All
                orders placed by Users on the Platforms are subject to the availability of such Product, Superkicks’s
                acceptance of the User’s offer and the User’s continued adherence to the terms of the Agreement.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para9">2.9. You agree to maintain and promptly update all data provided by you
                and to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue,
                inaccurate, not current, incomplete, or if Superkicks has reasonable grounds to suspect that the
                information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current, incomplete, or not in accordance with
                the terms of the Agreement, Superkicks reserves the right to indefinitely suspend, terminate or block
                your access to the Platforms, and refuse to provide you with access to the Platforms in future.</p>
            <p class="tcToUser_heading_para10">2.10. The Services included on or otherwise made available to the Users
                through the Platforms are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any representations or
                warranties, express or implied, except if otherwise specified in writing. Superkicks does not covenant
                or warrant that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2.10.1. the Indian Contract Act, 1872;</li>
